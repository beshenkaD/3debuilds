Last Updated Date: February 21, 2017 SIDE EFFECTS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT IMPORTANT - READ CAREFULLY: Side Effects Software Inc. or its subsidiary (as applicable, "SideFX") licenses this software and all upgrades and related materials (collectively, the "Software"), excluding any open source software that is distributed with the Software, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. BY SELECTING "ACCEPT", OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE, ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT BECOME LEGALLY BINDING ON YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR ON THE ORGANIZATION THAT YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU THE INDIVIDUAL (A) DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, OR (B) ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DOWNLOAD OR INSTALL THE SOFTWARE OR TO AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOUR ORGANIZATION, YOU ARE REQUIRED TO SELECT "DO NOT ACCEPT", IN WHICH CASE YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE. NOTE: The terms and conditions of this Agreement were last updated, and are effective as of, the "Last Updated Date" indicated above. Any downloading, installation or Use of the Software or an earlier version of the Software that was licensed prior to such date is governed by prior terms and conditions, which differ from those set out in this Agreement. 1. GENERAL 1.1. Formation of Legally Binding Contract. A legally binding contract is immediately formed upon your acceptance of this Agreement. The licensee who is bound by this Agreement ("Licensee") is: (i) the individual accepting this Agreement, if the individual is licensing the Software for his or her personal use or use as a sole proprietor; or (ii) the corporation, institution, partnership, organization or other entity ("Organization") on whose behalf the individual accepting this Agreement is acting. Where a Transaction Confirmation is provided to Licensee, Licensee's name will be confirmed in the Transaction Confirmation. Where no Transaction Confirmation is provided to Licensee and Licensee obtains an Entitlement(s) or License(s) through the online process, Licensee's name will be the name provided as part of the online process or, where no name is provided, the name associated with the email address provided or used as part of the online process. The Entitlement(s) and License(s) issued to Licensee will be associated with such name. Licensee represents that the name provided to SideFX, if any, is its full and correct legal name. 1.2. Application and Priority of Terms. The terms and conditions of this Agreement apply regardless of, and take priority over, any terms and conditions applicable to Licensee's software or, subject to Section 3.11, any third party software which may be used in conjunction with the Software. 1.3. Subsequent Licensing; Upgrades. Subsequent licensing of the Software may be subject to updated terms and conditions that differ from those set out in this Agreement (an "Updated Agreement"). SideFX may require Licensee to accept an Updated Agreement in connection with: (i) any subsequent downloading and/or installation of Upgrades; or (ii) the issuance of subsequent Entitlements or Licenses to Use the Software (see Section 2.2); in which case any downloading, installation of Use of such Upgrade (in the case of (i)), or any Use of the Software under such Entitlements and Licenses (in the case of (ii)), will be governed by the Updated Agreement. An Updated Agreement will be indicated by a change to the "Last Updated Date" indicated at the top of this Agreement. If Licensee obtains additional Entitlements and Licenses to Use the Software without having to accept an Updated Agreement, this Agreement will continue to apply to Licensee's Use of the Software under such Entitlements and Licenses. 1.4. Communication of Usage Data. Licensee acknowledges that the Software may communicate to SideFX certain technical, non-personal information concerning Licensee's Licenses and Use of the Software. Licensee hereby consents to such communication. 1.5. Information Provided by Licensee. Licensee represents, warrants and covenants that any information provided by Licensee to SideFX concerning Licensee's identity, contact information, Authorized Users, revenue, applicable project or otherwise is, and will continuously be, true and accurate and not misleading. Licensee agrees to notify SideFX of any changes in such information. 1.6. Defined Terms. Section 12 sets out certain defined terms used in this Agreement. 2. RIGHT TO USE 2.1. Grant of Rights. Subject to Licensee's payment of the applicable fees and continuous compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, SideFX hereby grants to Licensee a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable right for Authorized Users to install and Use the Software: (i) solely in object code format; (ii) solely in the applicable Territory; (iii) solely for the Usage Purpose; and (iv) subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable License Type (as set out in Section 3). 2.2. Entitlements and Licenses. Licensee acknowledges that Use of the Software requires: (i) the issuance by SideFX of an Entitlement(s); (ii) the redemption of such Entitlement(s) by Licensee to obtain a License(s); and (iii) the installation of such License(s) on the applicable Computer using the tools provided as part of the Software. SideFX will issue Licensee an Entitlement(s) based on the applicable License Type and permitted Use. Each License permits Use of the Software on a single Computer (in the case of a Workstation Installation) or on a single Network Server and single Client Computer (in the case of a Network Installation). 2.3. Licensee Responsibilities. Licensee shall: (i) take appropriate action to ensure that non-Authorized Users do not Use the Software; (ii) ensure that all Authorized Users comply with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the restrictions set out in Section 4.1; (iii) be solely responsible for any digital assets or other content that is uploaded to the Software by Authorized Users, including compliance with any restrictions imposed by the author of the content and any violations of intellectual property rights; (iv) be solely responsible for the accuracy, integrity, legality and appropriateness of all content created by Authorized Users using the Software; and (v) Use the Software in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations (including those relating to export, homeland security, anti-terrorism, data protection and privacy) and any documentation included with the Software. Licensee shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by Authorized Users and any installation or Use of the Software by persons other than Authorized Users utilizing Licenses issued to Licensee. Licensee shall immediately notify SideFX of any unauthorized installation or Use of the Software. 3. LICENSE TYPES AND SCOPE OF USE 3.1. License Types. The Software is provided to Licensee subject to specific terms and conditions that further define the scope of Licensee's permitted installation of Licenses and Use of the Software based on the type of license granted ("License Type"). The License Types, and the terms and conditions applicable to each License Type, are set out in Appendix A to this Agreement. Licensee must not, and must not attempt to, install any License(s) or Use the Software outside of the scope of the License Type that applies to the License(s) issued to Licensee. Any actual or attempted installation of Licenses or Use of the Software outside of the scope of the applicable License Type is a breach of this Agreement and an infringement of the rights of SideFX. 3.2. Additional Limitations and Restrictions. For greater certainty, the limitations and restrictions of the applicable License Type are in addition to all other limitations and restrictions under this Agreement, including those set out in Section 2, Section 3 and Section 4. 3.3. Network Installation. Certain of the License Types provide for Network Installation. "Network Installation" means that each of the Licenses issued to Licensee may be installed on one (1) Computer acting as a license server (the "License Server") that can be accessed by other Computers acting as clients ("Client Computers") through a local area network connection or through a VPN connection, provided that: (i) the VPN connection is secure; (ii) each Client Computer is within the Territory; and (iii) the Software may only be Used on the Client Computers accessing the License Server. The number of Client Computers accessing the Licenses on the License Server(s) and on which the Software is being Used concurrently shall not exceed the number of Licenses issued. For example, if Licensee has been issued ten (10) Local Access Licenses, each of the ten (10) Licenses may be installed on a License Server, and the Software may be Used on a maximum of ten (10) Client Computers at any given time. For certainty, each of the Licenses issued to Licensee does not have to be installed on the same License Server, but any single License cannot be installed on more than one License Server. 3.4. Workstation Installation. Certain of the License Types provide for Workstation Installation. "Workstation Installation" means that the License may be installed on one (1) dedicated Computer and the Software may only be Used on that Computer. Unless otherwise expressly provided in Appendix A, the License cannot subsequently be relocated (i.e. installed on a different Computer). 3.5. Location. The rights granted under this Agreement provide for Use of the Software in the applicable Territory and certain of the License Types may provide for Use of the Software only at a particular location. Authorized Users will be considered to be Using the Software in the Territory (or at a particular location) only if the individual is physically located within the Territory (or at the particular location) at the time he or she is Using the Software. 3.6. Use of Cloud Services. For certainty, notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Licensee may only install the Software, or have a third party install the Software for Licensee, for use with a Cloud Service if the License Type that applies to the Licenses issued to Licensee is a Global Access License and only for non-interactive processing. Otherwise, Licensee is not permitted to install or have installed or Use the Software on a Cloud Service regardless of the location of the Computers utilized by the Cloud Service. For certainty, non-interactive processing includes processing using Houdini Mantra, Houdini Engine and Houdini Batch, but excludes processing using Houdini Core or Houdini FX. Nothing in this Section shall be taken to limit any restriction set out in Article 3 or otherwise in this Agreement. 3.7. Use of Third Party Rendering. Except for Users under an Apprentice License, Users may utilize third party software (the "Third Party Rendering Software") for the purpose of rendering images created using the Software; provided that with respect to Indie Licenses: (i) the Third Party Rendering Software and its dedicated Houdini plug-in must be installed and used on the same dedicated Computer on which the Software is installed and Used; (ii) the User must not render sequences at a resolution higher than 1920x1080; and (iii) the User shall Use only the final work product produced by the Third Party Rendering Software and shall not access or Use or have any rights in or to any temporary or intermediate images or files produced by the Third Party Rendering Software and/or its dedicated Houdini plug-in. Within ten (10) days of a request by SideFX, the third party who provides the Third Party Rendering Software and its dedicated Houdini plug-in shall certify in writing to SideFX the extent to which such third party has implemented technical measures to prevent any breach of such restrictions. For certainty, Users under all License Types other than the Apprentice License and the Indie License may utilize Third Party Rendering Software for the purpose of rendering images created using the Software, without reference to the restrictions and requirements set out in this Section (but, for certainty, subject to the restrictions that otherwise apply to such License Types). 3.8. Non-Concurrent Use. For all License Types, only one individual may Use the Software interactively (i.e. operating the Software through its graphical user interface) on a Computer (including, for certainty, a Client Computer or a dedicated Computer) at any given time. Without limiting the foregoing in this Section, where the Software is being Used interactively on a Client Computer or a dedicated Computer by an individual, a second individual may not Use the Software on that same dedicated Computer or Client Computer indirectly through a separate Computer, terminal or monitor. 3.9. Limits on Number of Licenses. SideFX may limit the number of Licenses of a particular License Type available to any particular Licensee, alone or together with its related individuals and Affiliates. 3.10. Orbolt. Digital assets that are authored Using the Software can be uploaded to and downloaded from the website maintained by the SideFX affiliate, Orbolt Inc., at www.orbolt.com (the "Orbolt Website"), pursuant to the Orbolt Inc. Terms and Conditions of Website Use. Notwithstanding the prohibitions on Commercial Use under the Non-Commercial Licenses, the Software may be Used under the Non-Commercial Licenses (as well as under the Commercial Licenses) for the purpose of authoring digital assets for upload to the Orbolt Website. Any other Commercial Use of the Software under a Non-Commercial License is strictly prohibited. Any digital asset that is downloaded from the Orbolt Website may be further developed subject to: (i) the terms of the applicable License Type under which the digital asset was downloaded; and (ii) any restrictions imposed by the author of the downloaded digital asset or by the License Type under which the digital asset was created. 3.11. Open Source Software. The Software may be accompanied by certain open source software (in source code and executable forms, as applicable) (the "Open Source Software") that works with the Software. The Open Source Software forms, and is distributed as, a separate and independent software program from the Software (and the Software is not a modification of, or a work based on, the Open Source Software), even though the Open Source Software may have been aggregated or packaged with the Software for purposes of distribution. The Open Source Software is distributed under and subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable open source licenses and notices set out at http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/licenses/ (the "Open Source Licenses").

CERTIFICATION AND INSPECTION 10.1. Certification. Within ten (10) days of a request by SideFX, a Certification Authority of Licensee shall, after making due inquiry, certify in writing to SideFX, as applicable: (i) that Licensee (and in the case of a Global Access License, each applicable Licensee Affiliate and third party Authorized User) is, and has continuously been, in full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all applicable restrictions and limitations on installation and Use of the Software; or (ii) the extent to which Licensee (or in the case of a Global Access License, any applicable Licensee Affiliate or third party Authorized User) is not, or has not been, in full compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all applicable restrictions and limitations on the installation of Licenses and Use of the Software. Licensee shall provide such supporting evidencing as SideFX may reasonably request. "Certification Authority" means: (a) Licensee, where Licensee is an individual; or (b) a senior officer, signing authority or other senior official of Licensee, where Licensee is an Organization. For certainty, failure to provide the certification as required by this Section is a material breach of this Agreement that entitles SideFX to terminate this Agreement and to any other remedies that may be available to SideFX at law or in equity. 10.2. Inspection. SideFX or its authorized representative may at any time after written notice to Licensee, electronically or otherwise, reasonably inspect Licensee's (and in the case of a Global Access License, each applicable Licensee Affiliate's and third party Authorized User's) records, systems and facilities in order to ensure compliance with this Agreement. Licensee will provide (and in the case of a Global Access License, ensure that each applicable Licensee Affiliate and third party Authorized User provides) full cooperation in connection with any such inspection, including the provision of such additional documentation and information as SideFX may reasonably request. Licensee shall ensure that the agreement between Licensee and each applicable Licensee Affiliate and third party Authorized User includes the right for SideFX to perform such inspections. 10.3. Remediation. If as a result of a certification pursuant to Section 10.1, or an inspection pursuant to Section 10.2, SideFX determines that Licensee's (or in the case of a Global Access License, any applicable Licensee Affiliate's or third party Authorized User's) installation of Licenses or Use of the Software is not, or has not been, in conformity with this Agreement, Licensee shall promptly: (i) obtain the applicable Entitlement(s) or License(s) from SideFX required for such installation or Use; (ii) pay the applicable fees in respect of such License(s) for prior and future Use; and (iii) pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by SideFX in respect of the certification or inspection, as applicable. 11. MISCELLANEOUS 11.1. Relationship of Parties. In giving effect to this Agreement, neither party will be or be deemed an agent of the other for any purpose and their relationship in law to the other will be that of independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a partnership in law or a joint venture between the parties. Neither party will have the right to enter into contracts, pledge the credit of or incur expenses on behalf of the other. 11.2. No Waiver. Any waiver of any terms or conditions of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the party granting such waiver. Such waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it has been given and shall not be deemed or constitute a waiver of any other provisions (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. The failure of either party to exercise, and any delay in exercising, any of its rights hereunder, in whole or in part, shall not constitute or be deemed a waiver or forfeiture of such rights, neither in the specific instance nor on a continuing basis. No single or partial exercise of any such right shall preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right. 11.3. Severability. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any terms or conditions of this Agreement, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. 11.4. Assignment. Licensee shall not assign or transfer this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder (whether in connection with or as a result of any consolidation, arrangement, reorganization, amalgamation, acquisition, merger, sale, operation of law, or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of SideFX (which consent may be withheld by SideFX in its sole and absolute discretion). 11.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter and there are no representations, warranties, conditions or other agreements between the parties in connection with the subject matter hereof except as specifically set forth herein. 11.6. Binding Arbitration. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, all disputes relating to this Agreement shall not be submitted to the courts for resolution, but may be submitted to final and binding arbitration by either party pursuant to the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario) (the "Arbitration Act"). The arbitration shall be treated as confidential and will be held in Toronto, Canada. The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of one arbitrator (the "Arbitrator"). The party that wishes to initiate the arbitration (the "Applicant") shall deliver a notice to that effect (the "Notice to Arbitrate") to the other party, which notice shall nominate an individual to act as the Arbitrator. Within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of the Notice to Arbitrate (the "Response Date") the other party (the "Respondent") shall, by notice to the Applicant, either signify its acceptance of the nominee or, in the alternative, propose an alternative individual to act as the Arbitrator (the "Response"). If the Respondent fails to provide a Response by the Response Date, the Respondent shall be deemed to have accepted the Applicant's nominee for Arbitrator. If the Respondent provides a Response by the Response Date suggesting an alternative individual to act as Arbitrator, the Applicant shall within thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of the Response, by notice to the Respondent, signify either its acceptance or rejection of the Respondent's nominee for Arbitrator. If the Applicant fails to provide notice by such date, the Applicant shall be deemed to have accepted the Respondent's nominee for Arbitrator. If the Applicant provides notice by such date signifying its rejection of the Respondent's nominee for Arbitrator, the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective nominees to select the Arbitrator. Any costs associated with same shall be borne equally by the parties.
